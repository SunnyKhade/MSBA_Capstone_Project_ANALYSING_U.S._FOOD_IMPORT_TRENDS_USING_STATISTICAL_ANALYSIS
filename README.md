# 📊 Capstone Project: Analyzing U.S. Food Import Trends Using Statistical and Forecasting Techniques

## 🎓 Project Context
This project was completed as part of the **MS in Business Analytics** program at the **University of California, Riverside (Spring 2025)**. It focuses on identifying trends, forecasting import values, and understanding volatility in U.S. food imports.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze historical import data across food categories (Meats, Grains, Dairy, etc.)
- Examine relationships between import value and volume
- Forecast future import trends using **Linear Regression**
- Identify high-volatility years and recommend prescriptive strategies

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **R** (ggplot2, dplyr, readxl, tidyr)
- **Excel** (for raw data)
- Visualization and modeling in **RMarkdown/PDF**
- Final deliverables in **PDF** format
